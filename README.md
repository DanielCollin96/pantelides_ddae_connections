# pantelides_ddae_connections
This folder contains the MATLAB source code used to compute the presented results of the numerical tests performed in the paper "How to find all connections in the Pantelides algorithm for delay differential-algebraic equations" by Daniel Collin, Technische Universit√§t Berlin.

Open and modify the script main.m to create desired scenarios. Examples and commentaries are given in the script. Run the script to redo the computations that were performed in the paper.
